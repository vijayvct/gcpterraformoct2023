Terraform 
---------

Traditional way of managing infrastructure 

E-Commerce Application (Asp.NET Core, MS Sql Server, Windows Server + IIS)

Dev -> QA -> Staging -> Production -> Disaster Recovery 

An IT Admin will manually create the required infrastructure to run the application for each team

Drawbacks 
---------
Repetitive Process
Human Errors 
Time Consuming 

Infrastructure as Code 
----------------------
Infrastructure as Code (IaC) tools allows you to manage infrastructure with configuration files rather than through a GUI

IaC has become an integral part of the modern software development, enabling teams to provision, configure and manage infrastructure resources programmatically 

IaC allows you to build, change and manage infrastructure in a safe, consisent and repetable way by defining resource configuration that you can version,reuse and share 

IaC tools uses declarative syntax to define the infrastructure config and create them 

AWS - CloudFormation(JSON or YAML)
Azure - ARM Templates (JSON), Azure Bicep(JSON like syntax)
GCP - Deployment Manager(YAML)

Imperative Approach 
-------------------
Python script for creating a GCP Compute Engine VM 

Terraform 
---------
Terraform is a IaC tool developed by HashiCorp
It lets you define resource and infrastructure in a human readable, declarative configuration file and manage your infrastructure lifecycle
It provides following advantages over the manual process of infrastructure management 

-Terraform can manage infrastructure on mulitple cloud platform 

-The human-readable configuration languages help you write the infrastructure code quickly 

	HashiCorp Configuration Language (HCL) - .tf files 
	JSON - .tf.json file 
	
-Terraform's state allows you to track resource change throughout your deployment 

-You can commit your configuration to version control system to safely collabrate on infrastructure

HCL Use Block Syntax in the terrform configuration files which looks as follows 

block_type "label" "name_label"
{
	key1="value1"
	key2="value2"
	
	nested_block{
		key="value"
	}
}

#a block to create a VPC network in GCP 

resource "google_compute_network" "vpc_network"{
	name= "terrform-network"
} 

How to use Terraform to manage Infrastructure?
---------------------------------------------
Terraform Cloud :- It is cloud based solution to create configuration files. It is paid service

Terraform CLI :- A standalone tool to manage infrastructure with clouds. It is free to use 

For Windows, download the zip file and extract it into C drive 

	C:\Terraform - Set the path in the enviornment variable 
	
	set path ="C:\Terraform"
	
	Editor - Visual Studio Code 
	Extension - HashiCorp Terraform Extension 
	


Authentication 
--------------
Terraform in Google Cloud 
	-Cloud Shell - has the lastest version of the Terraform CLI installed by default and no authentication keys are required for executing the scripts from the Cloud Shell 
	
Outside Google Cloud 
	-Create a Service Account for the project where you need to manage the infrastructure
	-Create and Download the access key which will be used by Terraform to authenticate and connect to your GCP Account

Terraform Workflow 
------------------
init->validate->plan->apply->destrory

terraform init 
--------------
It is used to intialize a working directory containing terraform configuration file. It download the required provider binary in the working directory 

terraform validate 
------------------
It is used to validare the terraform configuration file in the respective directory. It check the syntax and internal consitenancy of the file 

terraform plan 
--------------
It is used to create a execution plan 
It performs a refresh and determines what actions are necessary to achieve the desired state specified in the configuration file 

terraform plan 

terraform plan -out "plan1.tfplan"

terraform apply 
---------------
It is used to apply the changes required to reach te desired state of the configuration file. By default apply scans the current dircetory for the configuration and applies the changes appropriately 

	terraform apply --> enter yes on the prompt to apply the changes 
	
	terraform apply --auto-approve 
	
	terraform apply -auto-approve plan1.tfplan
	
terraform destroy 
-----------------
It is used to destroy the terrform managed infrastructure

	terraform destroy --> enter yes on the prompt to apply the changes 
	
	terraform destroy --auto-approve
Variables and Data Types 
------------------------
Variables 
---------
Input Variables 
Output Variables
Local Variables

Input Variables - Serves as parameters for Terraform modules, so user can customize behaviour without editing source config file 

The input variables can be created in the main.tf( file containing the actual config) or we can manage the variables in sperate file (variables.tf)

variable "name_label"{

	type = value #data type of variables 
	description = value #describe the variables 
	default = value #contains value to refered by the variable 
	sensitive= true | false 
}

eg :- 

variable "network-name"{
	type=string 
	description="VPC Network name"
	default="terraform-network"
}

to refer the variable in the terraform configuration

	var.<name_label>
	
resource "google_compute_network" "mynetwork"{

	name = var.network-name
}

Terraform Variables Data type
-----------------------------
Primitive 
	String 
	Number 
	Boolean 
	
Collection 
	List 
	Set 
	Map
	
List 
----
[1,2,3,4] - valid list of numbers
["us-central1","us-east1","us-west1"] - valid list of string 

[1,"us-east1",true] - Invalid List 

Map
---
images ={
	image1="ubuntu 20.04"
	image2="ubuntu 22.04"
	image3="ubuntu 22.10"
}

var.images.image1 or var.images["image2"]

.tfvars files :- helps us to provide values to the variables that we are using in the configuration file 

By default, we can use the terraform.tfvars file to provide values for the all variables that we are using in the configuration file 

Random Provider 
---------------
The random provider allows the use of randomness with Terraform configuration
This is a local provider, which means that it will work entierly with the Terraform's logic and doesn't interact with any other services

Output Variables :- It makes information about your infrastructure available on the command link and can expose information from other Terraform configuration to use 

output "name_label"{
	value = output_value
	description ="description of ouput"
	sensitive = true|false
}

output "mybucket"{
	value =  google_storage.bucket.my-bucket.name
}

Local Variables or Values :- It provides a convenience way for assigning name to an expression

	local{
		prefix="ct"
	}
	
	local.<name_label>
	
Remote State 
------------

State 
-----
Terraform uses state which stores the information about the managed infrastructure and configuration
This state is used by terraform to map real world resources to your configuration, keep track of metadata to improve performance of the large infrastructure

This state is store by default in a local file name terraform.tfstate

When you are working in a team, the state file can be store in remote backend to avoid any inconsistency in the state

The state file can be stored in the following locations
	-Terraform Cloud 
	-Amazon S3
	-Azure Blob Storage 
	-Google Cloud Storage 
	-Alibaba Cloud 
	-Oracle Cloud 
	
Modules 
-------
Modules are self-contained package of Terraform configuration that are manged by a group 
It provide with pre-build configuration files using which we can create the required infrastructure without writing the whole configuration code from scratch 

Virtual Machine (Compute Engine Instance)
	-Source Image
	-Disk or Storage 
	-VPC
	-IP Address 
	-CPU and Memory 
	
	
Built-In Module 
Custom Module 

	Custom Module for creating VPC Network, Subnet and VM 
	
	Root Module 
		main.tf
		variables.tf
		output.tf 
		
			VPC 
				main.tf
				variables.tf
				output.tf
			
			VM
				main.tf
				variables.tf
				output.tf

Terraform Provisioner
---------------------
Terraform Provisioners are used for executing scripts or shell commands on a local or remote machine as a part of resource creation or deletion 

provisioner "local-exec"{
	
}

local-exec :- it help to execute commands on the local system

remote-exec :- it helps to execute commands on a remote system 



Terraform CLI - Open Source version 

	Terraform.exe 
	
Terraform Enterprise 

Terraform Cloud 
---------------
Terraform Cloud is an application that helps team use Terraform to provision infrastructure

It manages Terraform runs in a consistent and reliable enviornment and include easy access to shared state and secret data , access control for approving changes to infrastructure, a private registry for sharing Terraform modules, detailed policy control for governing the content of Terraform Configuration and more 

Terraform Cloud is available at https://app.terraform.io

Workflows 
---------
In Terraform Cloud, your resource are organized by workspace which contains your resource definition, enviornment, input variables and state files 

A Terraform operation occurs with in a workspace and Terraform uses the configuration and state for that workspace to modify the infrastructure

3 Workflows 

The CLI driven workflow which uses Terraform standard CLI tools to executes runs in Terraform Cloud 

The Version Control System (VCS) driven workflow, in which changes pushed to version control repositories trigger run in the associated workspace 

The API-driven workflow which allows you to create tooling to interact with Terraform Cloud API programmatically
